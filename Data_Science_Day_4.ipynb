        "## Think of NLP as the technology that helps computers understand and work with human language (like English, Hindi, etc.). It’s used in things like chatbots, Google Translate, voice assistants (Alexa, Siri), and spam filters.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **2. What is CountVectorizer?**\n",
        "## Imagine you have a few sentences and you want a computer to understand them. But computers don’t understand words—they understand numbers. CountVectorizer helps by converting words into numbers based on how often they appear.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **3. What is Naïve Bayes?**\n",
        "## Naïve Bayes is a simple but powerful algorithm used in NLP to classify things like spam emails, positive/negative reviews, or even emotions in text. It works using probability. It calculates how likely a word belongs to a category (e.g., spam or not spam).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "If an email has words like **\"free money\"** or **\"win now,\"** Naïve Bayes checks the probability of these words appearing in spam emails.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the probability is high, it marks the email as spam.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "- If a dog barks, it's probably a dog.\n",
        "\n",
        "- If a cat meows, it's probably a cat.\n",
        "\n",
